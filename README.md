# R - pokedex

## Objectives

This is a project with the aim of getting comfortable with the basics of react and putting to practice what i have been learning of css/scss and architecture in general. As such, global objective is to create reusable components that follow SOLID principles and good software architecture practices in general.

I am aware of my current junior level so this also serves as a milestone of both how far i have gotten until now and of how far from this i will get in the future. I know the project could get better and probably has awful code, but that's the point, to detect where i can get better by coding.
