# R - pokedex

## Objectives

This is a project with the aim of getting comfortable with the basics of react and putting to practice what i have been learning of css/scss and architecture in general. As such, global objective is to create reusable components that follow SOLID principles and good software architecture practices in general.

I am aware of my current junior level so this also serves as a milestone of both how far i have gotten until now and of how far from this i will get in the future. I know the project could get better and probably has awful code, but that's the point, to detect where i can get better by coding.

## To do

    - [ ] color palette
    - [ ] theme changing
    - [ ] responsive
    - [ ] loading views
    - [ ] sidemenu sidebar
    - [ ] slide in pokemon card animations
    - [ ] Error handling

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
